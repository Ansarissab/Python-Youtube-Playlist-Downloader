# Python YouTube Playlist Downloader

## Overview

This Python script allows you to download the entire contents of a YouTube playlist. It supports downloading videos in different resolutions and provides progress tracking during the download process. The script utilizes the Pytube library for fetching video information and the requests library for downloading the videos.

## Features

- Download all videos from a YouTube playlist
- Choose the resolution of the downloaded videos
- Display progress during the download process
- Automatically skip videos that have already been downloaded
- Handles cases where certain resolutions are not available for specific videos
- Multi-threaded downloading for improved performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pytube library
- tqdm library
- requests library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/python-youtube-playlist-downloader.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```
   pip install pytube tqdm requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.

2. Run the script with the URL of the YouTube playlist as an argument:

   ```
   python main.py <playlist_url>
   ```

   Replace `<playlist_url>` with the URL of the YouTube playlist you want to download.

3. The script will start downloading the playlist. Progress will be displayed for each video, and a summary will be provided once the download is complete.

## Configuration

- You can modify the `max_workers` parameter in the `download_playlist` function in the `main.py` file to specify the maximum number of concurrent downloads. Adjusting this parameter can improve download speed but may also increase system resource usage.
